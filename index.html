                                                <p>Scher is a contemporary American artist and graphic designer. She is seen as one of the most influential graphic designers as she
                                                    has been described as a <figcaption>“master conjurer of the instantly familiar” </figcaption> graphic design by The Pentagram. Paula Scher was born
                                                    October 6th , 1948, in Virgina, but when she was a child, she moved around a lot, so she grew up between Philadelphia and 
                                                    Washington DC. This was due to her father's job as a photogrammetric engineer for the US Geological Survey. She would have 
                                                    seen the newest technologies and innovations from an early age. This is also where Scher found her love for art as her dad 
                                                    is and influence on her.  Although Scher’s father and mother were against her going to an art school he later decided to let 
                                                    her attend. Her mother was from Brooklen New York and at an early age she would visit her relatives, driving through the 
                                                    Holland Tunnel which inspired her <figcaption>“The typography of the Holland Tunnel is emblazoned in my memory as this entryway to 
                                                    something big and powerful.”</figcaption> During high school she studied art and was known for making poster for big events at school like 
                                                    football games, that she would never attend she just did it because <figcaption>“I just thought I was good at art.” </figcaption> Scher grew up, she 
                                                    attended the Taylor school of Art, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, where she completed her bachelor's degree of Fine arts. While 
                                                    she was there, she struggled her first semester until she picked up Graphic design were she <figcaption>“found out that graphic design 
                                                    wasn’t about that, it was about ideas.” </figcaption> career began in the 70s and early 80s when her eclectic approach to typography 
                                                    became highly influential. As a child Scher said she <figcaption>“I always knew that I wanted to be an artist.”</figcaption> </p>

                                        <p>She then completed a move to New York in the 70s to begin her professional career where she worked as a layout artist at random
                                            House’s Children’s book division. She decided to leave this job and found another one in CBS records in the advertisement and 
                                            promotion department. Two years later she joined a competing label, Atlantic Records, as an art director. This is where she 
                                            <figcaption> “Started out as an illustrator” </figcaption> designed her first album cover. This led to her later returning to CBS records for eight 
                                            years producing over 150 album covers annually. After eight years, in 1982, she resigned from CBS records. Her typography was 
                                            influenced by Russian constructivism and without imitating its style she only made use of its vocabulary form.  </p>

                                        <p>In 1984, she decided to team up with a fellow graduate, Tyler Koppel, an editorial designer. They created a firm named Kopper 
                                            and Scher. They ran it for seven years where she designed the iconic Swatch poster after the Swiss designer Herbert Matters work. 
                                            Then in 1991, Koppel left the company to become a creative director for Esquire magazine. Scher also decided to leave as the 
                                            company was crumbling after the recession. She left for Pentagram where she became phenomenally successful, she began in the 
                                            design studio as partner of the company and eventually worked her way up the ladder to become the principal. </p>
